# Jamazon


The jamazon store only has 10 products and anything that goes out of stock will never be replenished.

Purchasing something is a 2-step process. Just look at the complete list of items and select an ID(1-10). Then input a desired quantity for said item. The final price will be printed if enough of this product is in stock. If not, a message should print informing you of insufficient stock. Upon rerun, the store's new quantity should be updated.
